# Anki Rapid Fire

Add-on for Anki 2.1


**I am not developing this further, as I don't think the concept is sound. I am leaving the code here for the interested. From trying this out, I think it ultimately prevents you from learning cards above a certain difficulty by not letting you see them enough times in a session. So I have abandoned this idea.**

The goal of this project is the help you learn unordered flashcards faster.

Imagine you have a deck of 500 vocabulary words. Some of them will be easier than
others to memorize. Let's say your minimum interval is 1 minute. You will end up
cycling through 1 minute worth of your hardest words as you learn the easy ones, leaving
only hard words in your learning queue. To
fix this problem, this addon moves "learning" cards to the bottom
of the new card queue if you miss them 10 times in a row. That way you will blaze
through all the easy cards and you won't be looking at hard cards for the entire
study period.

Currently, this also does not
change the experimental scheduler. 

**Warning: This will  reset the data on your _lapsed_ cards as well
